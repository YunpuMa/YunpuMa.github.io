### About Me

I develop intelligent systems that integrate memory, reasoning, and multimodal understanding to act autonomously in open-ended environments. My goal is to develop foundation models and agentic systems that continually learn, collaborate, and adapt to complex, real-world tasks.

I am currently a lecturer at [CIS LMU Munich](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/), where I teach the course *From Large Language Models to AI Agents*. I am also affiliated with the [Munich Center for Machine Learning](https://mcml.ai/) and serve as a group leader at the [TRESP Lab](https://tresp-lab.github.io/), supervising PhD students and leading research on LLMs, multimodal models, and agentic AI. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from LMU under the supervision of Prof. Volker Tresp, with a focus on relational learning, cognitive modeling, and quantum AI. Prior to that, I studied theoretical physics, conducting research at the Max Planck Institute for Physics. I also collaborate closely with academic and industrial partners, including [Prof. Hinrich Schütze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIL9dWUAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Volker Tresp](https://tresp-lab.github.io/), [Prof. Sören Pirk](https://www.vcai-lab.org/), [Prof. Evgeny Kharlamov](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=-slpMF8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Kristian Kersting](https://ml-research.github.io/people/kkersting/), and others. I also supervise several industry-funded PhD students from Siemens, Huawei, and Bosch, etc.

My current research explores the design of AI agents equipped with persistent memory, advanced reasoning capabilities, and the ability to operate autonomously in open-ended settings. A central focus is on developing LLM-based (multi)agentic systems that perceive and process multimodal inputs—such as language, vision, and structured data—while continuously adapting through reflection and self-improvement. These agents aim to support robust planning, problem-solving, and decision-making across both scientific and industrial domains.

### Research Interests

- Memory-augmented agents for long-term adaptation  
- Multi-agent systems with communication and coordination  
- Self-improving agents in open-ended environments  
- Scalable large reasoning models
